What I learned: Through this project I learned a lot about new array methods like .map(), .filter() and Object.keys() to mention a few. Plus I've also learned how to create a playlist now using JavaScript.

Struggles: In the beginning I really struggled to understand the purpose of the arguments in the function and how to properly use these new array methods. Another big struggle was trying to get the guardians genre's songs from the other array.

Improvements: Definitely gotta look at solving a problem in different ways and always try out these new methods in future projects.
